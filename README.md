# Jupyter widget example

This is intended as a straightforward example of how to build a pure-python widget that uses a Model-View-Controller design. It works with `ipywidgets 5+` and `traitlets 4.1+`. This is not currently packaged for installation via pypi. Instead, download it as a zip from github, or, even better, clone it and improve it!
